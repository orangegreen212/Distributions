A simple web application built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to visualize different probability distributions (Normal, Exponential, Uniform, Binomial) using histograms and density plots.

## ‚ú® Demo

## ‚ú® Features

*   Generates random data for four common probability distributions:
    *   Normal
    *   Exponential
    *   Uniform
    *   Binomial
*   Interactive interface using Streamlit to select the distribution to view.
*   Displays clear histograms using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
*   Includes Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) overlay for continuous distributions.
*   Shows basic data generation parameters in the sidebar.
*   Uses a fixed random seed (`142`) for reproducible results.

üêç Code

The core logic for the Streamlit application is located in the app.py file.
